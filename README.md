# ENGG233_Digital_Dashboard

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

This project aimed to create a console application dedicated to calculating the resistance of 3, 4, 5, or 6 band resistors. This is specifically targeted for students working in labs, who can then reallocate time usually spent towards calculating resistances, towards actual lab work.

### Project Objective

The project objectives included:

1.	To gain experience with programming in the C# language, specifically practicing new skills such as enums, switch statements, and static vs instantiated classes. 
2.	To solidify general programming concepts such as functions, loops, try statements, and more importantly, error handling. 
3.	To solve a real-life problem, no matter how small, that Iâ€™ve been facing.

## Technologies

The technologies used include:

1. Processing 3.5.3
2. Library org.gicentre.utils.stat.by Jo Woods 

## Launch

In order to launch this project, simply download the folder DigitalDashboard. Once you have the neccessary technologies downloaded, open the file named DigitalDashboard.pde and click "Run" in the top left.
